        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>Young woman (lady) • Introduction • You aren't yet married and are preparing yourself for that stage of life while honing other areas. You may still be under parental care or, for many, already independent. This moment is crucial as it prepares you for marital life, independence, motherhood, and increased responsibility.</p>
          <p>Our society has diverse views on these matters, but in this forum, we aim to uphold a more godly standard.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Young woman (what awaits you?)</h3>
          <p>You may be completing your studies or already starting a career, and these may occupy most of your days. However, it doesn't end there. Depending on your country of origin, marriage may be an unavoidable topic.</p>
          <p>Before going any further, remember that there is no lateness in any of these areas —education, marriage, or motherhood. As long as you are making the most of the opportunities presented to you, just keep moving forward with confidence.</p>
          <p>Your identity is not defined by marriage or career but by being a daughter of the Most High God. Keep this in mind as we move forward.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Young lady (A case study)</h3>
          <p>This is a Christian forum, so most of our case studies will be from the Bible. It is full of wisdom and not just personal experiences, ensuring that our advice can be truly impactful for you.</p>
          <p>Have you ever heard the story of Rebecca (Genesis 24)? She was a young lady like you, living under parental care. What I want you to notice is her behavior and good heart. She wasn't fetching water to be noticed; it was simply a household chore she was doing. She decided to fetch water for all the camels and even proposed them to come over to their house.</p>
          <p>In the process of obeying her parents (doing the will of God), she applied what she had learned from her parents and from God, and she obtained a husband. And not just any husband—the only son of Abraham, the father of faith. Rebecca is remembered throughout history today.</p>
          <p>What would have happened if she had filled her heart with bitterness, sadness, or distraction?</p>
          <p>You are not late in the eyes of God; He is preparing you for what He has in store for you. You need preparation for any task, so don't go through it with bitterness, but with joy through faith. The blessing of Rebecca will surely be yours.</p>
          <p>Remember to Trust God, He gave His only Son to save you, don't doubt on trivial needs of this world, your God is far greater than that. His timing is not your timing.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Another case study</h3>
          <p>Let's consider another example, this time focusing on Dina, a daughter of Jacob, from Genesis 34. Dina was a young girl from a good family. There's something important to note from her story. Dina left her house to see the other girls in the city. While strolling through the streets, she was seen by the prince of the country. She was taken advantage of and later asked in marriage.</p>
          <p>Do you notice the difference between Dina and Rebecca? One significant distinction is distraction and idleness—two powerful tools the devil uses to lead young ladies astray. Rebecca was not idle; she was always busy helping her mother and happily running errands when asked. Dina, on the other hand, was likely idle at home and decided to go out just to see the city girls. How long could that take? Where exactly was she going? What would she see or do there?</p>
          <p>Because of her idleness and distraction she brought her whole family to be guilty of murder. The devil does not come to you just to steal. He also kills and destroys don't give him access in any part of your life.</p>
          <p>If there's one lesson to learn from these stories, it is to stay busy doing what God has given you to do. By doing so, you are learning and equipping yourself with the tools needed to successfully accomplish your future duties.</p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Young lady (Sexual Purity)</h3>
          <p>I guess when you hear of sexual purity you think of remaining virgin or abstaining from sexual intercourse with a man. While that is very true and an important part of sexual purity, it's not all. If you are a Christian you may know that our mind is a major way through which we can sin. Sexual purity requires abstaining from any activity or thought which is sexually impure.</p>
          <p>You may have known the Lord while not being a virgin anymore or after a rape. You can still become sexually pure. You are a new creature in Christ Jesus (1 Corinthians 5:12)</p>
          <p>The images you watch, what you do to your body while alone, what you do over a call with a boy or man all affects your purity.</p>
          <p>We are required to offer ourselves as a living sacrifice unto God (Romans 12:1). God wants your body, soul and mind to belong to Him wholly.</p>
