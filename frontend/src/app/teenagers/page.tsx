        <p>
          You are at a pivotal point in your life, standing between childhood 
          and womanhood. The decisions you make now can have a 
          significant impact on your future. You are full of energy and, for 
          many, still under parental care. Surrounded by friends, this is a time 
          when a lot can happen.

        <h2 className="text-lg mb-4">Your spirituality</h2>
        <p>
          This is the genesis of your identity. Without a 
          spiritual foundation, you may face physical and 
          mental challenges. You were created by a loving 
          God who desires to make you His daughter. He has 
          already paid the ultimate sacrifice for you. Will you 
          open your heart and accept the sacrifice of Jesus? 
          Will you give Him full control over your will?
        </p>
        <p>
          If your identity is in Christ, you will not be swayed 
          by seasonal or societal changes because you will 
          know who you are. You will understand the 
          greatness of your Heavenly Father and how 
          precious you are to Him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision to follow Him and learn about Him 
          through His Word (the Bible) and prayer is a 
          significant step in your life, and it is beneficial to 
          make this commitment while you are still a 
          teenager.

        <h2 className="text-lg mb-4">Health care</h2>
        <p>
          You are at a point where many changes are occurring in a phase called 
          puberty, you are seeing changes in your body, your appearance 
          becomes more feminine.
        </p>
        <p>Here is what you need to do:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>First, don't panic! All the changes you're experiencing are normal 
          and biological—you're not alone, we all went through this.</li>
          <li>You're growing taller than your male peers, and that's completely 
          normal. This growth spurt will slow down by the age of 16.</li>
          <li>Your breasts are starting to develop, so you might need a bra to feel 
          more comfortable and presentable.</li>
          <li>Your biological clock is also starting. You may soon see (or have 
          already seen) some blood coming from your private parts—this is 
          called menstruation. Let your mom know as soon as it happens.</li>
          <li>Use a calendar app on your phone to track your cycle, noting the 
          number of days from your last period to the next. This helps you be 
          prepared with pads and avoid any accidents.</li>
          <li>Due to your growth spurt, your daily calorie intake requirement has 
          increased to 2200 calories. Focus on essential nutrients like 
          calcium, iron, zinc, and vitamin D. Don't neglect dairy and green 
          veggies, but try to limit candies, fast food, and sodas to avoid 
          excess fat.</li>
          <li>Stay physically active and balance screen time with other activities 
          like sports, reading, and doing household chores.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2 className="text-lg mb-4">Mental Health</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to the changes in your body, your mind is also 
          going through many transformations. This is because 
          you're experiencing numerous changes and challenges in 
          a short period of time, all while your brain is still 
          maturing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you feel very anxious, have trouble sleeping, or feel sad 
          all the time, don't keep it to yourself — talk to God about 
          your feelings, open up to a parent of trust. Fill your mind 
          with the word of God and not the lies of the enemy. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In today's world, where teenagers are exposed to social 
          media and peers at school, comparison and low self-
          esteem can become significant problems. Remember, you 
          were created in a unique way by your heavenly father and 
          you are beautifully made for a purpose in Christ. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that all things work together for your good 
          and no matter what happens remember to trust God he is your 
          heavenly father and is aware of all.

        <h2 className="text-lg mb-4">What should you do at this time?</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Focus on Your Education: Your brain is at a stage where learning comes easily, so make the most of it and 
          do your best in your studies.</li>
          <li>Seek a Good Relationship with God: This time of life is relatively free from stress (financial, relationships, 
          etc.). Use these fruitful years to diligently know God more through His Word (the Bible) and prayer. Desire 
          to please Him in everything you do.</li>
          <li>Be a Friend to Your Mum: No one on this earth can love you more than your parents. Confide in them, and 
          share your emotional and physical struggles—they will be of great help. Don't take your age mates as 
          counselors; they are as naïve as you.</li>
          <li>Surround Yourself with Christian Friends: If your friends have the same goals as you, that's the best for 
          you. Don't chase after friends who make you feel inferior or desire things you shouldn't have right now. 
          Certain things are for future use—don't try them now, as they will waste your time and be emotionally 
          draining.</li>
          <li>Discover and Perfect Your Talents: Whether it's music, singing, drawing, painting, playing a sport, or 
          writing, let these activities keep you busy after school hours.</li>
        </ul>
